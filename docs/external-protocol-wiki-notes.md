# External protocol notes — JohnRThomas wiki, Gadgetbridge, ayroblu (2025–2026)

> **Document type:** G1 reference — external comparison
> **Audience:** Anyone integrating with or reverse-engineering the Even Realities G1
> **Evidence basis:** Cross-reference against external sources: JohnRThomas wiki, Gadgetbridge `even-g1-custom-drawing-experiment` branch, ayroblu/bazel-demo Swift implementation (not capture-based)

> **Note (2026-09-07):** the same author also maintains
> `JohnRThomas/even_realities_decomp`, a Ghidra decompilation of the G1
> firmware itself. That is a much stronger source than this wiki for anything
> structural, and it is written up separately in
> [firmware-decomp-notes.md](firmware-decomp-notes.md). Where the wiki and the
> decompilation disagree about packet structure, the decompilation wins.

Artifact:

- `JohnRThomas/EvenDemoApp` wiki page: `Even-Realities-G1-BLE-Protocol`
- URL: `https://github.com/JohnRThomas/EvenDemoApp/wiki/Even-Realities-G1-BLE-Protocol`
- Last noted edit on the page: `Dec 30, 2025` (per the GitHub wiki header)

This document is a **pointer + gap list** for later investigation. It is not a
new source of truth and should not override the app’s “trusted behaviour” list
in `AGENTS.md` or our live-test-derived findings in:

- `docs/even-g1-event-mapping.md`
- `docs/protocol-reference.md`
- `docs/FINDINGS-*.md`

## What the wiki seems strongest on (relative to our current docs)

### `0x22` status packet hypotheses

The wiki proposes concrete field layouts for at least two `0x22` “Status”
message variants (including dashboard/pane mode + page-ish fields). In our app,
we currently treat `0x22` as a dashboard-family packet and mostly log it rather
than decoding it.

Why this matters:

- If we ever want to do something smarter with dashboard state (unread counts,
  pane/page inference, low-power hints), `0x22` is a plausible place to start.

Suggested follow-up:

- Add a debug-only (`COMPANION_VERBOSE_LOGS=true`) decoder attempt for the
  `0x22` shapes against our captured logs, and explicitly mark it “hypothesis”
  until validated.

### `0x26` touch/settings family breadth

The wiki lists multiple `0x26` “Hardware Set” subcommands and labels
`0x26 … 05` as “Set Double Tap Action”.

What we already have:

- We already use and have live-confirmed `0x26 06 00 <seq> 05 <value>` as the
  persisted “double-tap action” setting, and we document the confirmed values
  in `docs/protocol-reference.md`.

Potential value:

- The wiki’s additional `0x26` subcommand catalogue might help us prioritise what
  to investigate next (without re-deriving everything from snoops).

### `0x29` brightness get (readback)

The wiki documents a “Brightness Get (0x29)” request/response shape as
`29 65 <level> <auto>`, claiming byte 3 is an auto-brightness flag.

**Empirical probe results (firmware 1.6.6):** Two separate probes against
current firmware returned byte 3 = `0x00` in both cases, even after
auto-brightness had been enabled via the official app and via the companion
app. This leaves two interpretations open:

- The wiki is wrong about byte 3's meaning; or
- The firmware does not persist the auto state across BLE disconnect — it
  resets to OFF on every fresh connect regardless of what was last written.

The existing capture data does not let us distinguish between these. Byte 3
is therefore **unverified** on firmware 1.6.6. The level byte (byte 2) is
consistent with the `F5 12` echo and appears reliable.

**Firmware decompilation (2026-09-07) narrows this.** The `0x29` parser reads
two distinct stored fields:

```
case 0x29:  *param_3 = param_1[0xed5];   // byte 2 — brightness level
            bVar2    = param_1[0xf9c];   // byte 3 — separate stored field
```

and it assembles the response by forwarding the request over SPI to the
**other temple** (`FUN_00019d14` -> `master_process_put_req`) and returning
that leg's reply.

Two consequences:

- Byte 3 is a real field with its own storage, so the first interpretation
  above ("the wiki is wrong about byte 3's meaning") is now the weaker one.
  It could still be mislabelled, but it is not absent.
- Because the value comes from the *other* leg over SPI, a `0x00` reading may
  reflect that leg's state or the timing of the inter-leg round trip rather
  than the auto flag. Any future probe should query both legs.

**Resolved 2026-09-08 — the wiki is right.** A closer read settles it. Opcode
`0x01` (brightness set) takes `param_2[4]` as level and `param_2[5]` as the
auto flag, and writes the auto byte to `param_1[0xf9c]` — precisely the field
`0x29` returns as byte 3:

```
case 0:  /* opcode 0x01 */          case 0:  /* opcode 0x29 */
  ... param_1[0xf9c] = param_2[5];    *param_3 = param_1[0xed5];  /* level */
                                      bVar2    = param_1[0xf9c];  /* auto  */
```

So byte 3 is the auto-brightness flag, and this is a case where the wiki was
ahead of our empirical reading rather than behind it. The two probes returning
`0x00` need a different explanation: auto genuinely off at probe time, or the
readback answering for the wrong leg. Re-probe with auto confirmed on, querying
both legs.

See `docs/firmware-decomp-display-relay.md` § 5 for the full working.

For this app's handling, see `current-architecture.md` — “Authoritative
settings model” — which moots the reconcile question by re-pushing on every
connect.

Cross-reference: `docs/protocol-reference.md` — “Brightness: `0x01 <level>
<auto>` and `F5 12 <level>`”.

## Areas where our docs appear ahead (and the wiki is TODO / missing detail)

The wiki has many high-level “Operations” sections that are still `TODO` (text
rendering, image display, AI dictation, navigation, notifications, etc.).

In contrast, we already have working, capture-backed notes for several newer
rendering/control families beyond `0x4E` text and BMP, including:

- `0x52` live streaming text (cursor-style incremental)
- `0x0a` navigation structured card
- `0x1e` TX dashboard data slot injection
- `0x50` dashboard lock (originally read as display mode control)

Those are documented in:

- `docs/protocol-reference.md`
- `docs/FINDINGS-layouts.md`

## Event mapping differences to treat cautiously

The wiki includes labels such as:

- `F5 01` = “TouchPad Single Tap”
- `F5 1E` / `F5 1F` = dashboard open/close (double tap)

We should not treat these as product-ground-truth for this app because:

- Live testing (as of `2026-04-28`) has **not** confirmed reliable app-visible
  single taps in the states we care about.
- Our current model treats `F5 1E` / `F5 1F` as “dashboard/state follow-ons”
  (and we explicitly document additional follow-ons like `F5 30/31` in
  `AGENTS.md`).

Action:

- If we ever revisit these mappings, do it via fresh captures + live testing,
  and keep the “trusted behaviour” list authoritative.

## Additional external references (found 2026-04-28)

### Gadgetbridge `even-g1-custom-drawing-experiment` branch

- Repo: `codeberg.org/jrthomas270/Gadgetbridge` branch
  `even-g1-custom-drawing-experiment`
- Contains a comprehensive `G1Constants.java` with named constants for most
  command and event families. Not all constants are used in the implementation
  — several rendering-related sections are stub/TODO.

Key value for us:

- **`NavigationSubcommand`** names all six `0x0a` sub-commands:
  `INIT (0x00)`, `TRIP_STATUS (0x01)`, `MAP_OVERVIEW (0x02)`,
  `PANORAMIC_MAP (0x03)`, `SYNC (0x04)`, `EXIT (0x05)`, `ARRIVED (0x06)`.
  `SYNC` is a commit/render signal, not just a "ready" marker. The official
  app sends SYNC both before AND after the card data.
- **`DashboardSetSubcommand`** (`0x06` family): sub-commands for
  TIME_AND_WEATHER (0x01), WEATHER (0x02), CALENDAR (0x03), STOCKS (0x04),
  NEWS (0x05), MODE (0x06), CANVAS (0x07).
- **`DashboardQuickNoteSubcommand`** (`0x1e` family): sub-commands for
  audio metadata get, audio file get, note text edit, audio file delete,
  note status edit, note add.
- **`HardwareSubcommand`** (`0x26` family): confirms our DOUBLE_TAP_ACTION
  (0x05) and adds DISPLAY (0x02), LUM_GEAR (0x04), LUM_COEFFICIENT (0x06),
  LONG_PRESS_ACTION (0x07), HEAD_UP_MIC_ACTIVATION (0x08).
- **`EventId`** confirms all our F5 mappings and adds:
  `ACTION_LONG_PRESS (0x12)` — the intermediate event between hold (0x17)
  and release (0x18). Also `ACTION_DOUBLE_TAP (0x20)` is labelled as
  "strictly a double tap" rather than "transcribe".
- **`CommandId.UNKNOWN = 0x50`** — they don’t know what 0x50 does either.
- **`CommandId.TELEPROMPTER_CONTROL = 0x09`**, **`TRANSCRIBE_CONTROL = 0x0D`**,
  **`TRANSLATE_CONTROL = 0x0F`** — direct mode-entry opcodes we haven’t used.

### ayroblu/bazel-demo Swift G1 protocol implementation

- Repo: `github.com/ayroblu/bazel-demo` path `g1-app/g1protocol/`
- Contains a working Swift implementation of the G1 navigation protocol.

Key value for us:

- **TRIP_STATUS packet structure decoded**:
  `[null, seqId, 0x01, DirectionTurn_enum] + x_coords + [y, null] +
  totalDuration\0 + totalDistance\0 + direction\0 + distance\0 + speed\0`
  The `DirectionTurn` enum (0x01–0x23) maps to turn types: Straight (0x02),
  Right (0x03), Left (0x04), SlightRight, UTurnLeft, roundabout variants, etc.
  Our snoop showed `0x03` = Right for the Church Road instruction — matches.
  The `x`/`y` coordinates and DirectionTurn byte in our snoop prefix
  `01 03 c8 00 12 00` decode as: sub-cmd=0x01, turn=Right(0x03), x=[0xc8,0x00],
  y=0x12, null=0x00.
- **MAP_OVERVIEW is 136×136 pixels, RLE encoded** — not 108×108 as we assumed
  from the BMP service. RLE format confirmed as simple `<count> <byte>` pairs
  from the ayroblu Swift source (`runLengthEncode()` / `runLengthDecode()`).
  Pixel layout is **row-major, LSB-first** (NOT column-major as we initially
  assumed). Image is two layers (image + overlay boolean arrays concatenated
  via `(image + overlay).toBytes().runLengthEncode()`), total 4,624 raw bytes.
  The `toBytes()` packs bools LSB-first (bit 0 = first pixel in each group
  of 8). Band splitting: 185-byte chunks, 9-byte packet header per band.
- **PANORAMIC_MAP is 488×136, UNENCODED** — raw bitmap, not compressed.
- **SYNC/poller has a pollerSeqId byte**: `[0x0a, length, null, seqId, 0x04,
  pollerSeqId]`. Our implementation uses 0x01 for this byte.

## Investigation backlog derived from all comparisons

1. Validate or reject the wiki’s `0x22` field breakdown against our logs.
2. ~~Probe `0x29` brightness get on current firmware~~ — **PROBED**: byte 3
   (wiki-claimed auto flag) returned `0x00` on two probes even after auto was
   set ON; unresolved whether wiki is wrong or firmware resets auto on
   disconnect. Moot for this app — authoritative-settings model re-pushes on
   every connect anyway.
3. Cross-check the wiki’s `0x26` subcommand list against our `docs/FINDINGS-settings.md`
   and snoops to see if any high-impact settings are missing from our current
   mapping.
4. ~~Try using the proper DirectionTurn enum byte in TRIP_STATUS~~ — **DONE**:
   `classifyManoeuvre()` in `nav_icon_generator.dart` maps instruction text
   to `ManoeuvreType` enum (0x01–0x0b). Full DirectionTurn values confirmed
   from ayroblu Swift source.
5. ~~Investigate `0x0a` acked vs fire-and-forget~~ — **RESOLVED**: fire-and-forget
   (`sendData`) confirmed correct. Firmware does not ack `0x0a` commands.
6. Investigate whether SYNC needs a specific `pollerSeqId` value.
7. Try `TELEPROMPTER_CONTROL (0x09)`, `TRANSCRIBE_CONTROL (0x0D)`, and
   `TRANSLATE_CONTROL (0x0F)` as direct mode-entry alternatives to relying
   on the official app’s double-tap setting for `F5 20`.
